##  Key Learnings

### Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
- Use a **mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- Ensure password **length is at least 12â€“16 characters**
- Avoid **dictionary words** or **predictable patterns**
- Use **passphrases** that are long but easy to remember
- Avoid **reusing passwords** across multiple accounts

##  Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force**     | Tries all possible combinations; long/complex passwords resist this best. |
| **Dictionary Attack**| Uses common words or leaked passwords from dictionaries. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses known leaked credentials on multiple sites to gain unauthorized access. |

##  Summary

Password complexity directly influences the difficulty of cracking it. Weak passwords like `123456` are cracked instantly, while strong ones like `9x!P$Z@uR#bF1&cL` can withstand even powerful brute-force attacks. Tools like password strength checkers are useful in educating users and promoting strong password practices.
